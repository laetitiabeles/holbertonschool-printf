# C _PRINTF 
(*We would have called it Project FunPrintf because #CisFun, but we are serious people.*)

**In a nutshell** ðŸŒ°

Two Holbies at Holberton Lille picking their brains in order to program a function that mimics the basic functionalities of the printf() function.

## Description
Welcome to Funprintf, where we embark on a whimsical journey to create our very own printf function in the charming world of C programming! ðŸš€

Description

Ever dreamt of crafting your printf magic? Look no further! In this delightful project, we've conjured a simple, yet âœ¨magicalâœ¨, replica of the printf function from the C programming language.

With the help of *Variadic functions*, playful *structs*, and a cast of merry *helper functions*, our program can dazzle you by displaying **characters**, **strings**, **integers**, and even the mystical **decimals (base 10)**.

Whatever format specifier you throw at our _printf function (except the ones we haven't programmed), it promises to perform its trickery and mirror the results of the legendary printf function.

The **printf** typical syntax is : 

    printf("format", arg_1, arg_2, ..., arg_n); 
where *"format"* is the character string enclosed in double quotes, and *arg_1, etc.* represent the arguments for printing the character string.

*But the fun doesn't stop there! ðŸŽ‰ This project is not just about creating a printf clone; it's an invitation to explore an alternative method of crafting your own printf magic wand in the enchanting world of C.*



## Flowchart

![Flowchart](https://i.ibb.co/b2sPXLP/Capture-d-cran-2023-11-24-12-55-42.png)
## Prototype
    int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

Write output to stdout, the standard output stream.

format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail.



## REQUIREMENTS

Allowed editors: 
- vi
- vim
- vim, 
- emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc

All your files should end with a new line

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

No more than 5 functions per file

The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
## Man page

    man ./man_3_print
## Files

    _printf.c  

    _underscore_putchar.c

    getPrint.c

    main.h

    man_3_printf

    printCharacter.c 

    printNumber.c 

    printPercent.c 

    printString.c 
## Compiler

    **$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c -o printf**
## Test

The main.c File Test 

You'll make a main.c file to test the program, in order to see if the _printf function works exactly like how regular printf manages to. The main.c file should contain the code displayed below.

```
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "main.h"
/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */
int main(void)
{
    int len;
    int len2;
    unsigned int ui;
    void *addr;

    len = _printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
    len2 = printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
    ui = (unsigned int)INT_MAX + 1024;
    addr = (void *)0x7ffe637541f0;
    _printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len, len);
    printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len2, len2);
    _printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
    printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
    _printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
    printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
    _printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
    printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
    len = _printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
    len2 = printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
    _printf("Len:[%d]\n", len);
    printf("Len:[%d]\n", len2);
    _printf("Unknown:[%r]\n");
    printf("Unknown:[%r]\n");
    return (0);
}
```
